## About

This is a collection of gorgeous HTML transactional email templates, built using [Maizzle](https://maizzle.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

They are completely free and you can use them anywhere you like, although of course we recommend using our very own transactional email provider, [OhMySMTP](https://ohmysmtp.com)

And yes, they support Dark Mode out of the box :)

## Using the Templates

Production-ready templates are located in [/dist](./dist). To use them copy them into your application as email templates and modify any variables you want to include as per your application / sending software.

You can use [Maizzle's render method](https://maizzle.com/docs/nodejs/) to integrate with web application frameworks like Rails, Laravel and more.

## Modifying the Templates

While you can modify templates in the `dist/` folder directly, it's not recommended as you lose a lot of the pre-processing benefits. Instead follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repository

2. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm i -g @maizzle/cli
   cd templates
   npm install
   ```

3. Start Development

   ```sh
   maizzle serve
   ```

4. Modify the templates

   You can see detailed instructions in the [Maizzle Docs](https://maizzle.com)

5. Build for Production

   ```sh
   maizzle build production
   ```
   Your modified templates will be available in `./dist/`
